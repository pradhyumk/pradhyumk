# Welcome to my profile!
I'm glad you're here! I am an undergraduate student at Rutgers University, New Brunswick majoring in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. Feel free to browse through my repository.

This repository holds all of my academic assignments as well as self projects I have done throughout the years. 

## Self Projects:

### Telegram VirusTotal File Scanner
This is a file scanning bot on Telegram which takes a forwarded file from the user, uploads to VirusTotal, a antivirus engine aggregator, and replies with scan results. It has been deployed by an individual (not me) in a live environment.


### Rutgers Bus Google Assistant Action (archived) 
This project started as my entrance for coding in real-world applications. This project was a Google Assistant action which allowed the end-user to request live Rutgers bus information using the TransLoc RapidAPI. Unfortunately, Google had depreciated the Java Client library which was used to develop this action, and was therefore archived.
